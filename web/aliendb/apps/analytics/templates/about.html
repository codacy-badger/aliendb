        <h4>About AlienDB</h4>
        <p>AlienDB is an analytics platform for trending Reddit threads. It
          stores historical data for the top threads on Reddit, including karma
          trends and comment stats. This website is <b>not</b> affiliated with
          Reddit, and only accesses data which is publicly available.
        </p>
        <p>AlienDB monitors the top 100 submissions on
          <a href="https://reddit.com/r/all">/r/all</a> and periodically records
          information including each submission's rank, its number of comments,
          and its current karma. Additionally, each comment is analyzed using
          the <a href="http://nltk.org">Natural Language Toolkit</a> (NLTK) and
          <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io">TextBlob</a> for
          statistics such as polarity, subjectivity, gold given, and special
          user presence. Comment text is <b>not</b> stored.
        </p>
        <p>Statistics from individual submissions are also used to provide
          subreddit averages. It is important to note that only submissions
          which reach the top of Reddit are included in these averages, so
          subreddit averages should not be used as a way to describe a subreddit
          as a whole. Rather, it is a useful tool to determine whether an
          individual submission is significantly different than others which
          were also highly upvoted from the subreddit.
